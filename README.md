# The GOO Farm

Bring your GOO to the `GooFarm` contract, to grow your GOO like a professional GOO farmer. This is an ERC4626 vault so you get shares in proportion to your GOO deposit and will be able to burn them to withdraw total accumulated GOO.

If you own a Gobbler, bring it on down to the `GobblerPen`. This is a modified ERC4626 vault, where you get shares in proportion to the multiplier of each Gobbler you bring to the Pen. A small cut of all GOO production on the farm is set aside for the fine, hardworking Gobblerfolk in the Pen.

Now that our farm has some GOO and some Gobblers, we're ready to begin production. Head on over to the `Gooptimizooor`, where our top scientists are hard at work, distributing GOO across the Gobblers to optimize production.
