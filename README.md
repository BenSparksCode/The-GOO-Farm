# The GOO Farm

## An [Art Gobblers](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/09/artgobblers) Experiment

Bring your GOO to the `GooFarm` contract, to grow your GOO like a professional GOO farmer. This is an ERC4626 vault so you get shares in proportion to your GOO deposit and will be able to burn them to withdraw total accumulated GOO.

If you own a Gobbler, you can leave it at the farm as well. It will be socially integrated with the other Gobblers and have access to the farm's GOO supply - more than enough for a healthy, growing Gobbler. You'll get an ERC721 receipt token when you leave your Gobbler with us, so make sure to bring that back when you pick them up. It will entitle you to any GOO your Gobbler has generated during its time on the farm.

At some point in the future, we'll launch the GOO Farm governance token, or `GOOF`, via an airdrop. This is because we're too lazy to code a whole liquidity mining thing right now. With GOOF, you'll finally be able to do all your favourite DeFi things with The GOO Farm - like argue on governance forums about turning on the protocol fee switch. Good luck with that one.


### Gobblernomics

> "an inflationary utility token with specific in-game uses, very important not to get carried away" - Dave White

Initially we will set distribution of GOO production as follows:

 - 50% to Gobblers, in proportion to their total multiplier contributions
 - 50% to xGOO holders
 - 0% to the GOO Farm treasury

After the launch of the GOOF governance token, these distribution parameters may be changed through community proposals.
